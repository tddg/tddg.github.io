I am an Assistant Professor of [Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/){:target="\_blank"} 
and [Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science){:target="\_blank"} at
[the University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. 
I am interested in designing scalable, high-performance, and
easy-to-use computer **systems** that manage and process huge volume of
**data**.
My research covers a range of topics including distributed systems,
serverless and cloud computing, storage systems, operating systems,
and high-performance computing. 

Currently I am working on: 
(1) **Serverless and FaaS:** improving serverless computing using a
end-to-end approach that cuts across the entire software-hardware
stack: *(stateful) applications, middleware, platforms, and
lower-level OS/HW*
(watch this Youtube video summarizing our recent focus on serverless
computing); 
(2) **Sys4ML:** building better (computing and storage) systems for
distributed machine learning; 
and (3) **ML4Sys:** improving systems software and infrastructure
management by using learned or data-driven approaches.

Prior to joining UVA, I was an Assistant Professor of 
[Computer Science](https://cs.gmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at 
[George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, from 2017 to 2022.

I received my Ph.D. degree from  [Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at
[Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. 
During my Ph.D. I spent two summers at IBM Research Almaden in 2013
and 2014, and six months at Dell EMC Princeton Office in 2015.
