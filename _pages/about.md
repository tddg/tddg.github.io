I am an Associate Professor of [Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/){:target="\_blank"} 
and [Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science){:target="\_blank"} at
the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. 
My research covers a range of topics including distributed systems,
serverless and cloud computing, storage systems, operating systems,
and high-performance computing. 
My current research focuses on designing scalable, high-performance, and
easy-to-use computer **systems** that manage and process huge volume of
**data**.

Currently I am working on: 
(1) **Serverless and FaaS:** improving serverless computing using a
end-to-end approach that cuts across the entire software-hardware
stack: *(stateful) applications, middleware, platforms, and
lower-level OS/HW*; 
(2) **Sys4ML:** building better (computing and storage) systems for
(distributed) ML applications; 
and (3) **ML4Sys:** improving systems software and infrastructure
management by using learned or data-driven approaches.

I am the recipient of an 
[NSF CAREER Award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2045680&HistoricalAwards=false){:target="\_blank"} (2021), 
an Amazon Research Award (2021), 
a [Meta Research Award](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2022/9/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2022-ai-system-hardwaresoftware-codesign-request-for-proposals/?locale=en_US&draft=1284382378973290){:target="\_blank"} (2022),
and [the IEEE CS TCHPC Early Career Researchers Award for Excellence
in High Performance Computing](https://tc.computer.org/tchpc/2022/10/06/2022-ieee-cs-tchpc-award-winners/){:target="\_blank"} (2022).
Prior to joining UVA, I was an Assistant Professor of 
[Computer Science](https://cs.gmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at 
[George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, from 2017 to 2022.
I received my Ph.D. degree in [Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu/){:target="\_blank"} from
[Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, working with Dr.
[Ali R. Butt](https://people.cs.vt.edu/butta/){:target="\_blank"}. 
During my Ph.D. I spent two summers at IBM Research Almaden in 2013
and 2014, and six months at Dell EMC Princeton Office in 2015.
