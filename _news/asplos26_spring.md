ðŸŽ‰ Congrats to Ben and Jingyuan on the acceptance of NotebookOS
to [ASPLOS 2026](https://www.asplos-conference.org/asplos2026/){:target="\_blank"}!
In this work, we built a GPU-efficient distributed Notebook platform
that enables on-demand GPU allocation for interactive training
workloads such as LLM fine-tuning. Stay tuned for more updates on
the project!
