Congrats to Ao, Jingyuan, and Xiaolong on InfiniCache getting
accepted to USENIX FAST 2020! InfiniCache is a first-of-its-kind,
cost-effective, object cache that is built atop ephemeral cloud
funtions. InfiniCache is 31-96x cheaper than existing cloud cache
services (e.g., AWS ElastiCache) while offering same or better
performance. Fork InfiniCache on [GitHub](https://github.com/ds2-lab/infinicache){:target="\_blank"}.
