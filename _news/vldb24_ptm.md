Congrats to Zhaoyuan and Zirui on [his work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13429){:target="\_blank"} accepted to [VLDB 2024](https://vldb.org/2024/){:target="\_blank"}!
In this work, Zhaoyuan analyzed a large dataset of real-world
pre-trained ML models collected from Hugging Face. Based on the
analysis study, he designed a new storage compression method for
reducing the storage requirement of pre-trained models at scale.
